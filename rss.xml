            <title><![CDATA[Hoist is a small design and advertising consultancy office that I started in 2009. The people that I collaborate with, whether they be in accounting, creative or delivery, are all freelance. Hoist is a consultant for most of Jollibee’s design requirements, like packaging and store merchandising; was an account service for Philippine Airlines; an on-and-off graphic design provider for Mang Inasal, Aboitiz, Red Horse, Red Ribbon, and Aspac; and is the occasional slave to some small, nice projects here and there. – Nathan]]></title>
